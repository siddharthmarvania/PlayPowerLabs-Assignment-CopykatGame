I have try to replicate the CopyKat game using pixijs. The following are the feature of the game

* In this game you have to remeber the pattern draw by computer and try to repeat the same pattern.
* First computer will draw the pattern by highlighting the blocks.
* Then you have to draw the pattern by clicking on the blocks.
* If you are able to draw the correct pattern then you are advanced to next level.
* Otherwise you have to repeat the same level.

In this i have implemented the 2 levels. If you wish we can increase the level of game also. In this game levels are repeating in cyclic order like level1->level2->level1.
In level1 3 blocks are highlighted and in level2 4 boxes are highlighted.
